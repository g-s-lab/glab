Abstract: Many Poisson structures arising from Lie theory can be viewed
as defined by actions of Lie algebras and quasitriangular r-matrices. I
will explain how those Poisson structures can be naturally quantized using
any tensor structure on the fiber functor from the Drinfeld category to the
category of vector spaces.
