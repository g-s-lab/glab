Abstract: It is well known that the motion of an incompressible fluid on a
Riemannian manifold can be viewed as a geodesic flow for a certain
right-invariant metric on on the group of volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms. In my talk, I will review this framework and show how it
can be extended to incorporate certain discontionus fluid motions, known
as vortex sheets. It turns out that the corresponding dynamics is related
to a certain groupoid of "discontinuous diffeomorphisms". This is joint
work with B.Khesin.
