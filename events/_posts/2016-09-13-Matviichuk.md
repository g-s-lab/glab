Abstract: The present talk is a logical continuation of the talk I gave two weeks ago, however I will keep it self-contained (as long as you can believe in usefulness of Lie algebroids and Lie bialgebroids, aka Courant algebroids).

For a Lagrangian subbundle L in the Courant algebroid $$T+T^*$$, the exterior algebroid $$\bigwedge L$$ acts naturally on the de Rham forms $$\Omega$$. Whenever a transverse Lagrangian $$M$$ is chosen, we can embed the (graded) algebra of $$L$$-forms $$\Omega_L$$ into the (graded) algebra of (graded) differential operators on $$Omega$$. There is also a distinguished differential operator on $$Omega$$ -- the de Rham differential! This setting allow us to apply (a modification of) the Voronov's higher derived bracket method, by which we construct a natural family of brackets on $$\Omega_L$$. The bracket have arity 0,1,2 and 3 respectively, and are compatible in appropriate sense (that is, they form an $$L_\infty$$ algebra on $$\Omega_L$$). In the case, when both $$L$$ and $$M$$ are Dirac structures, the $$L_\infty$$ structure specializes to the differential graded Lie algebra controlling the deformation theory of $$L$$. Finally, we will discuss how does the constructed family of brackets on $$\Omega_L$$ depend on the choice of complementary Lagrangian $$M$$.
