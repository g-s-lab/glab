Abstract: The moduli space of flat $$G$$-connections over a Riemann surface $$\Sigma$$ is well known to admit a natural Poisson structure. If one looks at principal $$G$$-bundles trivialized over finitely many points $$v_1, ..., v_n$$ lying in the boundary of $$\Sigma$$, Fock and Rosly have constructed a Poisson structure on the corresponding moduli space of flat connections which depends on the choice of an $$r$$-matrix for each point $$v_j$$. We show that this Fock-Rosli Poisson structure is defined by a quasitriangular $$r$$-matrix, and is an example of a so-called mixed product Poisson structure defined by actions of pairs of dual Lie bialgebras.
