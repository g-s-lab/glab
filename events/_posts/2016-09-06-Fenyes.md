Abstract: Geometric quantization is a powerful but dauntingly sophisticated recipe for turning classical mechanical systems into quantum ones. Holomorphic quantization is a baby example of geometric quantization for linear systems, like small vibrations of a pendulum or faint sound waves in a gas. It illustrates the spirit of geometric quantization without all the technicalities. It also leads naturally to the idea of Feynman diagrams.
