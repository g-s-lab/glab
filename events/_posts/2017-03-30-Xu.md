Abstract: We first relate the Stokes matrices of certain meromorphic connections to Gelfand-Zeitlin systems.

We then discuss the quantization of the Stokes matrices and isomonodromy deformation equations. In particular, we show that the (quantum) Stokes factors of a Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov type equation satisfy Yang-Baxter equation. This part is joint with V. Toledano Laredo. We then discuss some related questions.
