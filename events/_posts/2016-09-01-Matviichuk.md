Abstract: Dirac structure is a lagrangian subalgebroid in a Lie bialgebroid. For a Dirac structure we construct a canonical isomorphism class of $$L_\infty$$ algebras, which controls the deformation theory of the Dirac structure. The results have applications to the deformation theory of holomorphic Poisson structures.
