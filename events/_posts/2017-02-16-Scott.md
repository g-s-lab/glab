Abstract: In this expository talk, I will describe real-world experiments that motivate why the fundamental forces of the standard model are defined as connections on principal bundles. The talk will be understandable to anyone with a firm understanding of differential forms, a weak understanding of principal bundles, and a dim memory of Maxwell's equations.
