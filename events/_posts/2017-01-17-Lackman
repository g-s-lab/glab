Abstract: Solutions to certain Lax equations which give rise to integrable systems have
an interpretation as time-dependent, matrix-valued sections of line bundles over elliptic curves.
In this talk an explicit example of such a matrix and its corresponding Lax equation will be constructed, in detail.
