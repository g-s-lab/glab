Abstract: In this talk, we discuss the theory of meromorphic line bundles, a modification of usual holomorphic line bundles, in the setting where D is a normal crossing divisor on a projective variety X. We will also mention the relationship of these geometric objects to some classical work of Griffiths on finite order line bundles and holomorphic curves.
