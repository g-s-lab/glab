Abstract: Blowing up a submanifold is a fundamental surgery-theoretical operation that exists in complex, symplectic and in Kähler geometry. In this talk I will explain to what extent the blow-up also exists in generalized complex geometry (a theory that unifies complex and symplectic geometry into one framework) and in generalized Kähler geometry.
