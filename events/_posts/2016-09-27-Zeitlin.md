Abstract: We demonstrate that the Einstein field equations with extra fields known as $$B$$-field and dilaton, have a nontrivial underlying algebraic structure, known as homotopy Gerstenhaber algebra. Such homotopy algebra is a natural object associated to Courant algebroid in the vertex algebra formalism. We show that the Einstein equations coincide with the Maurer-Cartan equations for the $$L_\infty$$ part of such Gerstenhaber algebra.
