Abstract: The generalized K채hler potential is a locally defined function used by string theorists to study N=(2,2) nonlinear sigma models, and as its name suggests, it allows one to recover a the tensors defining the structure in a regular neighborhood. By looking at a special class of generalized K채hler structures on toric symplectic manifolds, we will exhibit a link between the generalized K채hler potential and the symplectic potential of Abreu-Guillemin theory.
