Abstract:
1) Shifted symplectic structures: stacks, cotangent complex,
differential forms, shifted symplectic/Lagrangian structures,
Lagrangian intersections, mapping spaces

2) Examples: (quasi-)symplectic groupoids, (quasi-)symplectic Lie
algebroids, Courant algebroids, examples coming from groups

3) Shifted Poisson structures: definitions, coisotropic structures,
relation to shifted symplectic structures, (quasi-)Lie bialgebras,
symplectic realizations
